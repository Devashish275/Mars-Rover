Mars Rover Pictures Website
The Mars Rover Pictures Website is a web application that enables users to input a date and select a camera name to retrieve images taken by NASA's Mars rovers. By leveraging the Mars Rover Photos API, this application presents a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to explore stunning photographs captured on Mars. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application allows users to enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, choose from a list of available cameras, and click the "Get Photos" button to view the corresponding Mars rover images. To get started, simply clone the repository, open index.html in your web browser, and embark on a visual journey to Mars!
